              Ethan Reed, a close friend from college, is running for a seat on the Eau Claire City Council. As part of his campaign, I developed a multimedia marketing strategy to showcase his platform and vision for the community. This included establishing a consistent brand identity, creating designs for both digital and print media, and building a WordPress site to highlight his campaign&apos;s message.

              The project is still in progress, but I&apos;m currently preparing detailed documentation that will be available here soon. This will include a link to the live site, screenshots of the design, and examples of the graphics I created using Figma. Stay tuned for updates!
